# Outside the Reaction System

*...another energetic day with those young officers and crews from Earth.*

"Just finish right here," the captain put the computer into the drawer. Then she put on her cap and adjusted her dark blue tie. After going out of the captain room, she immediately turned to the corridor to the elevator. Suddenly, as the elevator door opened, she was surprised to see a sergeant standing inside. "Captain, it is late! Where are you going?" The young man asked, "I am checking the ship in routine."

"Going to the shipyard," the captain replied calmly after initial surprise, "Because we are going to overhaul the warship and equip improved main batteries that can shoot down bombers more efficiently." "But it is about 9 pm, the time for curfew in major cities here in Hapsaha," the crew replied. "I see, but it is urgent because of orders from the Command." Then, the elevator stopped, the door opening to the hangar facing the ground facilities outside.

"See you later, captain!" The captain waved her hand and quickly ran out of the large warship, entering the floating shipyard. She ran into the Maintenance Headquarters and saw few officers in duty. As she looked at the identifier, the stairs to the underground archives room appeared in dim light. While walking between the files, she suddenly saw someone standing in front of her.

"You are here, captain of destroyer Snowy Wind." A person said in low voice. "Mr. Military Attaché, glad to see you here," the captain saluted to the person standing in the shadow, wearing a different military uniform barely visible under the dim light. "How's your life there in the Earthlings' small flotillas?" "Quite relaxing and happy with those crews. But without your help in getting a passport and ID card in the country named Russia, I can't survive here as one of them," the captain replied.

"They only have differences in names of countries, in my surprise," the military attaché replied in a plain tone, "But your advantage in speaking Pansus language does make me find chance in the country of Russia." "Alright, so why call me here?" The captain said.

"I am here to inform you that our country is at war with those colonizers that drove the civilization you are here in and kidnapped you, just yesterday." "What? Why it started?" The captain was in surprise. "We had a new president, and he led the expansion of our Space Navy and liberation of previously occupied stellar systems by colonizers. They attacked our sole battleship battle groups." "I know nothing about it after being saved by locals in Earth," the captain was in shock after hearing the words.

"We are planning to contact those guys in charge of this stellar system and seek cooperation for resisting the colonizers," the military attaché replied, "But I am afraid that those locals who have been invaded by aliens will reject." "At least they hadn't figured out existence of another alien population from the new planet..." Suddenly, another continuous steps appeared in the basement.

The captain immediately turned to the officer, which seemed pretty young. The officer asked: "Why are you here in the basement near the curfew, captain Ariel and officer D'Souza?" Before the captain opened her mouth, the officer replied first: "We are discussing the overhaul affairs day after tomorrow, and we need to check types of weapons that will be renewed." "But...I think the the Command has issued that in documents given to you, captain," the officer replied, "And there are about five minutes available before the curfew." 

"As the captain, anything that goes wrong is my responsibility, so final checking without disturbing the Command is appropriate," the captain turned to the officer and said, "Don't worry." "Alright, I won't interrupt you, I will leave. But remember to leave the basement before 9 pm." "I know, comrade." As the officer walked away, the officer whispered: "Unbelieveable for locals to place you, a former captain in our civil aviation to a captain of destroyer. Luckily they know nothing about your past but your identity as a preivously missing Russian."

"Time is running out," the officer replied, "Ariel, I will try to inform your survival to the officers who are fighting against the colonizers. I think the 1st Fleet commander will be happy with your survival on a different civilization." "Alright...So, what about our next steps? Should we somehow leak the information to those Earthlings on top?"

"We are serving for their military, so we can't do so due to our hidden identities. Wait for anytime possible chance for half ship ashore," the officer said, "One minute remaining. Exit here." "I see." Slowly in the dim basement, the two officers walked onto the stairs and exited the basement.

As they approached the door, they saw some soldiers jogging to the headquarters with something moving towards them. They saw one soldier armed with body armor, metallic helmet, and a rifle. "Captain Ariel and officer D'Souza, you catch a right timepoint." "It is duty to obey orders from the Command," the officer replied, "So, why there are other comrades moving two mheavy machine guns and facilities here?"

"For anti-aircraft defenses," the soldier replied, "We are under overhaul, and defenses are strengthened according to the Command's orders." "I see," the officers replied, "Wish you a safe night."

......

Ariel slowly walked into the warship, seeing the First Lieutenant and the Assistant Damage Control Officer, as well as some crews beside them, checking something inside the hangar. "Captain, you are finally back!" Chen Dayou heard the steps and saw the lady in charge of the ship back, "If some crews hadn't informed us, we would have thought that you vaporized." "Come on, you can break into my room if I am missing," the captain replied in a fair tone, "I am just going to the office in the shipyard to discuss about the overhaul."

"What about the overhaul?" Chen Dayou asked, "By your order, we have switched routine for dozens of times to check the whole ship." "Be prepared for the day after tomorrow," the captain replied, "It is important not to play a firework with costs of lives and money." "Yeah, we will prevent it." The assistant damge control officer replied, "Anytime."

She walked into the same corridor, the same elevator, then turned to the same corridor where the captain room was. "Hey captain, beware of the ladder on the floor!" The captain finally looked at the ground and saw a ladder just two steps in front of her. "Oh, sorry!" After lifting it up, the captain saw the door and walked into the captain room.

As soon as she closed the door, she stood in the room for seconds, mouth slightly open and eyes fixed on the 1/450 model of the warship. "It's late now," she murmured, and then she shook her head. "Time to wash myself here and meet the crews and officers half an hour later." She put down her cap and unwrapped her jacket, putting them down on her table. After taking off her boots, staring at the ship model for another while, she walked to the door to her restroom.

......

"How many ships are still finishing up their outfitting?" "Maybe some destroyers! All the rest, including the cruisers and the two battleships have been included," the officer said, "It is too late to buy warships from other countries since the start." "What about the Galactic Brigades' arrival tommorrow?" The president asked, "They will arrive with some flotillas of destroyers and light cruisers in Afriko and Britanica. Pretty surprise that even some officials in Britanica demanded to support us."

"Let's see the plan..." The chancellor opened the holographic displayer and pointed to figures shown, "About five brigades, which equal to twenty-five divisions of our surface forces; their ships...if based on Unidos Estados de Grenada's fleet design, our battleships and cruisers can just be fighting behind the Galactic Brigade due to their slow speed and provide spacecraft support."

"The chief counselor of the Galactic Brigade is arriving the building, President Azania and Chancellor Benedict." An officer standing at the door said. "Send him in immediately." The president turned to the officer and said gently. One minute later, the president walked to open the gate and saw the a fairly figured man standing between two guards.

"Welcome, comrade Jefferson," the president greeted. "Morning, I have viewed the plan presented by your Secretary of Defense. Very concise about the formations in my country." "Doesn't it place formations of their space navy as secret?" "Not really," the counselor said, "They open it as they think no counrty in this galaxy can defeat them, at least now." "They have many novel ships, like spacecraft carriers. But as I know, Anamecer-locali did start researching it, until it was punched in the second Galactic War."

"Yeah...Based on your fleets, we can help organize multinational assault formations, with your fleet commanders in charge. But I suggest that we can't fight against them by our ship artillery." "Because of too small calibers and equivalence?" The chancellor replied. "Exactly. The only way to delay them or drive them away is to use our carrying bomber squadrons to interfere them, with other fighters as escorts. However, we must prepare for lack of pilots and necessity of artillery engagement."

"Acknowledged." The president replied, "Our draft plan is to reform our surface forces into combined divisions according to your framework, and about the combined fleet...can we rebuild our battleship groups after initial infliction?" "In what way?" The counselor asked, "At least those warships cannot form battle lines." "We form task forces in cores of one or two battleships and two or three heavy cruisers, with around dozen other ships as escort," the president replied. "If you and other comrades agree, we can spend the rest of the night coming out of the formations."
