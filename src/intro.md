# Preface 

The Galaxy we stay, like a pandemonium not yet open that some millions of people had thought, was about to throw the human civilization into a very big game that hardly any person can imagine. People had restored and preserved peace for past decades, not to mention memorizing an everlasting turmoil that ravaged the world we had seen scores of years ago.

Once, when the already unstable order from the Post-cold war era had ceased to exist, spills of blood and pain of death spread across the globe. Only after a true bloodshed that irrevocably changed the past made people unite. It was only not distant when people abandoned to build their national space arsenal and fighting against each other, and turned to build international space stations, developing what we now call "prototype space force".

Although seeing from now, using such a small force to defend other much larger enemies was like a full-armored knight charging to a mounted machine gun position, it was what we once had. Within the large United Nations, some wanted to defend within the atmosphere, some wanted to contact those aliens, while others just wanted to dig into Mars and hide forever.

Already dominating nations in the Galaxy were easy to put down battling civilizations, but not very easy to do so by bloodshed, if they wanted to exploit them more completely. Any unknown civilization, just by using locals to take down locals, was a small and easy task. Taking over a small stellar system could hardly fill their jaws. Therefore, they turned to target some new nations in the Galaxy, assimilating them by force, triggering massive resistance under their conquest, under their formidable fleets.

Once those enemies started to smash a nation that wanted to contact with us and defend itself against them, it was doomed that humans would be involved into indirect and eventually, direct contact with all those aliens and be combating those who decided that building contact with humans was more wasting than bloody conquest.

The same demand to drive those ferocious enemies outside the homeland led to a unification among civilizations, bearing a same cause and facing similar threats. Initially, no one could predict that an alliance formed by vast civilizations that hadn't learnt each other, threatened by overwhelming elite forces of those they called "colonizers", shadowed by a fall of a once noble nation, could spread light of truth to other civilizations before it was forcibly put off...

"We stood up at a wrong place and a wrong time, but we fought an absolutely right war against a right enemy."

Chen Dayou, District Commissioner of Yavin

# Some Basic Terms You May Need to Know

**United Nations:** The prevalent largest international organization in the globe, now serving as a global government after a turmoil.


**Space Navy:** A stellar civilization's spatial forces within its territory in space. It can include several combatant space stations and military satellites, or massive spaceships that resemble catogaries of ships in navies on Earth, such as battleships, cruisers, destroyers, escorts, etc.


**Hyperspace:** Tunnels in space functioning like a wormhole that allow massive spacecrafts to travel to another specific location over light speed.


**Surface Forces:** Land, naval, aerial, and support forces controlled by a civilization within her living planet's atmosphere and surface area. They take the job to occupy another civilization on land or sea of planets after space navies finish combat and seize priority.


**Superluminal Thruster:** Engines that are capable to drive spaceships in hyperspace.


**Stellar Docks:** Land-based or spatial platforms that allow freighters or spatial military vessels to park.


**Spatial Miles:** A universal unit for measuring firing ranges of spatial warship artillery, as well as speed of movement of ships between close stellar systems. Generally, 1 spatial mile, abbreviated as 1 sm, equals to 1.2 to 1.5 million km, which is 0.08 to 0.10 astronomical unit. The specific exchange data may vary in different nations, but most of the values fall in the range.


**Low-intensity Occupation:** A theory that proposes larger civilizations to contact indigenous people against the global government in a civilization, or another known planetary, to attack the current government, establishing indirect rules for the larget civilizations without using massive fleets to conduct forcible occupation. However, major expanding nations in the Galaxy chose to occupy by force.


**Consolidated Pneumonia:** A disease that is still causing great damage to civilizations in the Orion Arm and nearby Galactic regions after humans were involved in an interstellar war. Its symptons include some of those of normal lung diseases, and the most lethal characteristic is that pathogenic virus condense into blocks of lesions that can spread to other organs like cancer without stop, even during the process of chemotherapy, killing infected people in a slow but painful manner.
