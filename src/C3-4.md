# Fog of War Unveiled (1)

It was not until nearly one hour to midnight the Chairman and nearby officers, the Chairman, as well as Jason, witnessed the last survivor being carried out of the building. "Thanks, Jason," the Chairman looked at the young officer, "Now we will start the investigation after some unfortunately sacrificed comrades are all found." "We will, sir." Jason saluted.

......

"Why the captain hasn't moved back?" said Taguchi after waiting inside the bridge for hours. "I don't know," Eroshenko replied, "Dayou reported that she seems fine." "Maybe she is seriously injured and in hospital, in fact," an officer said, "Hundreds of others are killed or wounded upon the explosions." "Don't worry, at least the operations will be suspended," Taguchi continued, "Dayou will return here after he completes neutralization of the huge bomb. How the terrorists create such a havoc right inside one of the intensely defended area with such a traditional bomb is a serious question."

"The Damage Control Group from Snowy Wind has defused the bomb, and the crews will neutralize the bomb in ten minutes," Wendy reported to the Chiefs of Staff, "The Chairman gives me instructions from the General Secretary to mourn for deceased soldiers, officers, and crews. Besides, we will start an investigation right now, on those who may be suspects according to the list." She opened the screen and clicked on the file.

"And in particular, we must investigate deeply in those Hapsahan crews and officers, as well as some humans..."

"Drone ready?" Chen Dayou gave a gesture as he stared at the screen. "Ready." A crew controlling a remote control replied, "Position 202." The drone moved slowly to the device placed in a black box in a large empty sandy field, about three kilometers from the monitoring platform. "Carefully cut the red wire by laser weapon," an officer said, "Let's see this bomb's equivalence."

"It is estimated to be 15 kilograms of C4," Chen Dayou said, "Who knows what are additional explosives inside beside this instructed amount." "Alright! Three, two, one!" The officer said, "Glasses on!" As they wore the protective goggles, the officer pressed something, and a massive fireball erupted from smokes and thunderstorm-like noise of explosion. Everyone at the site bent down their bodies and covered their eyes.

"Not so strong as I expected," said Chen Dayou, "But at least enough to tear down our building basement." Just then, he heard his mobile phone ringing. "Hello?" He heard another unfamiliar voice saying, "Interception at the airport? Just leave it to guards...What? Our captain just asked to join? Alright. Don't let anything bad happen to her."

......

"Got damn it, we fail to bring down their headquarters," an alien officer said. She wore an entirely different uniform and complained. "Now we must reach their capital airport and bring back the plane. Where is my ship?" "Well, atleast behind shadow of one of their gas giants," a high-ranking officer said, "Don't worry, at least the Earthlings have no chance of knowing its position." "I certainly know it. Won't you permit me asking about my ship?"

"Yeah. Because the orders from the Command are here. Get out of the car."

As dozens of aliens jumped from the truck, where nearby there was a shuttle inside the hangar. "The same shuttle," an alien said, "Alright, let's do it." As the captain tried to get into it, a senior officer said. "Get out!" "Why?" She was surprised but determined. "You think that I will crash it in the middle?" "Precisely." Another senior officer said, taking out his pistol and immediately shot the captain two times. After she fell onto the ground, the shuttle immediately had its engines started and was moving forward in two minutes, leaving the wounded captain lying inside the hangar.

"Don't we need to search what she had left?" "Come on, we made their electronic systems work for us. No worries for possible leaking."

"The shuttle has taken off!" shouted Ariel, who was sitting in a jeep with D'Souza driving, and four others were inside. "Got damn it, they have escaped," she said in great hate. "Let's see what residue they had left," said D'Souza, "They must have hidden somewhere nearby and moved to the hangar. After grounding, they must have refueled the plane and did something that we did not notice, by hacking."

"Captain Takahama," said Ariel, "Beware, I have no idea on what weapons they will have." "But shouldn't your past experience reveal..." "Come on, comrades, brace!" said D'Souza as he was driving towards a fence, which behind was the hangar. As the jeep breached through, it immediately stopped at the gate of the hangar. "Someone is lying inside. Get our rifles and see it," the officer named Takahama said and opened the door.

Ariel headed there first, and immediately saw dark blood lighted up by the hangar light. "Who are you?" She immediately asked the lying alien similar in age and height. "The Captain...of the...Imperial Fleet," the lying alien said in a weak voice, "You are...coming too...late...they have...left." "Yeah, I know," Ariel quickly continued, "Who are you working for? What imperial fleet?"

"The...Pansus...Imperial...Fleet." Ariel's eyes suddenly popped out, and her face showed great surprise as if something was going to bring her down. "Call medics!" said a soldier. "I will," another soldier said, "But it seems to be late." "I am...only in the low...place...as captain of... destroyer," the dying alien continued as Ariel helped lift her up, "What I only know..." Suddenly she coughed, and blood flew from her mouth, staining the sky blue uniform that Ariel was wearing. "...is that...the country is a...warmongering state."

Suddenly she coughed again, with blood spilling out. "Before they rage...war onto you...come to the Coruscan...Republic. She is fighting...against the warmonger by all efforts. Reach their capital...and ask for help...they are willing to if you reach." "So, where is it?" The captain asked. "I have..." Using her last strength, she grabbed a thing out of her pocket and put the blood-stained stuff into the captain's hand. "This is...the copied navigation chart...of my ship. Take it...and get to it..."

Just as two medics with a stretcher arrived, they saw Ariel putting down the alien and shook her head, while she still held the alien's right hand. "It is too late. This alien being is once alive. Now do you have a white cloth?" "We will take care." "Has the Space Navy launched fighters to intercept this UFO?" asked Takahama. "They are on the way. But I doubt whether they can succeed. It is an alien aircraft."

As the medics took photos on the deceased alien and put the body onto stretch, carrying it away and leaving the bright hangar with sense and smell of blood and death, D'Souza asked: "Since we are too late to tell the truth, are we going to be interrogated as criminals?" "Nah, the Command, and the Security Council will takeover the whole investigation. It is such a shocking event that even 'shocking' can't describe the extent."

"But in all," Takahama continued, "Without you, we even can't get those warships. What did the dead alien tell you?" "It is a very serious matter that I had better tell those leaders soon."

......

"We can't even score a shoot!" complained Tim as he tried to avoid an incoming asteroid. "Should we abort the mission?" asked a pilot, "They are about to escape our radar detection range and heading to Saturn. We can't risk entering this undetected region." "We must go in," replied the squadron leader, "But Tim, are you sure to go to this area? Shouldn't we report to...the target has vanished!"

"Squadron 1 and Squadron 2, keep on searching near Saturn's ring, stay on contact," Tim said, "I am going to switch to 191.9, and relay any emergency to Natalia, Squadron 3. Squadron 4, come with me!" As Tim moved his control yoke, he and dozen fighters flew straight at the gigantic gas giant, "Beware of possible severe turbulence and flammable gases."

"Wait..." All of a sudden, a flash of light appeared in the dark space and vanished. For pilots who were just searching near Saturn, it was a monumental moment they had witnessed for humans and Hapsahan peoples.

......

"It is very clear that cause of death is excessive loss of blood, but..." said a medic standing beside a operating table, which was occupied by a dead body of an alien. "There is strong scorching patterns on the uniform and her remains showed signs of intense heat burned her wounded parts." "So, it is not done by our weapons?" asked an agent. "Yes, our weapons are based on laser beams, but this is not. It is very piercing compared to our weapons." "Well then, Ariel and D'Souza, while we may have to take further actions, come with us for more detailed info."

"Wait...what about others?" "We will take care. Need not to know." Accompanied by Captain Takahama and other agents or soldiers, two high-ranking officers, in fact, two aliens who never belonged to the Solar system, were facing a turning point that they could never return.
