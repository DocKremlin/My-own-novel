# Clearing off the Wastes

"Now I read the verdict..." The Presiding Judge from China's Supreme Court announced the final verdict after approximately 410 court hearings, "The court finds, all the accused--guilty as charged!" "Finally," said an intelligencer sitting beside me, watching the final court hearing from the holographic television, "We managed to catch their guilty and punish them." "I heard that the Chief of Staff of their 1st Fleet is about to be executed tomorrow, as sentenced by Hague." "Do you want to watch it in person?" Asked an officer standing beside a computer. "No. I don't think I can't get a sight in massive crowds."

Everyone who heard it laughed out loud, and then remained silent. Just then, the Presiding Judge announced: "...Therefore, the court sentences you to death by hanging." "Yeah!" Someone inside shouted. Everyone stared at him for a moment, then went to applaud. "Who is sentenced to death by hanging?" asked an officer. "The former 2nd Fleet commander," an officer just walking inside said, "He was responsible for killing aliens there."

"I can't believe that in a society much advanced to us can still produce people like that," an officer said. "Come on, such thing even happened a century ago," an intelligencer said, "Many of such crimes happened in that large war." "Shh! The next!"

"...The court sentences you to death by hanging." "It's who now?" "The former Prime Minister. The mad guy who claimed that he would start the whole mess again if he hadn't been there," I said to the intelligencer beside us. "Such a mad person like Tojo," one of my senior officers murmured, "Must be machine gunned to death." "Yeah..." some coworkers nearby nodded and replied.

"The captain is not sentenced to a crime on the court," someone said. "Who? What captain?" "I think the name should be Woodhill." A soldier sitting in the front row turned his head back and returned, "He was commanding the warship that we sank eventually." "Why the Tribunal does not capture him at this moment?" "I don't know," the soldier replied, "But as what I saw inside, he seemed to be coerced to implement the invasion; he did not order the ship to fire on any target until our fighters approached." "But he is one of the people responsible for the incident," an intelligencer replied. "Shh! Watch the live feed first," another officer said, "Leave debates behind temporarily, comrades."

"Ken Robinette, on the Counts of the Indictment which you have committed, the Tribunal sentences you to imprisonment of life." "That demon!" Another senior officer said in anger, "He is the traitor that drags our planet into this warfare that killed millions of people!" "Cheer for this!" Another intelligencer shouted. Everyone immediately clapped their hands.

"Comrades," our department officer walked in and got a box of juice carried in his both hands, "The headquarters gave us a box of bottles of juice, wanna drink one?" "Yeah!" An intelligencer sitting in her chair said, "You just come in time to compensate our loss in omitting death sentences of the other six war criminals!" "Shh! Now the ninth!" The intelligencer beside her patted her shoulder.

"Another imprisonment for life. It is just too easy for them to endure prisonment but not death," the department officer sat down after putting the box away. "I don't know why our judges may prevent them from being hanged," just then, a Hapsaha representative here suddenly spoke. "Yeah, I also do not understand," the intelligencer beside him said, "They are victims of war waged by those war criminals."

......

When I woke up next morning, our picket was standing beside. "Comrades, wake up. An important task is here for you. Sorry to interrupt your sleep." I rubbed my eyes and stared at the clock above the door: four o'clock in the morning. Other coworkers were just getting themselves from their beds. "Remember to wear formal uniforms and brush your teeth. We will prepare your breakfast later."

After dressing up properly, the picket ordered us to move out of the dorm quietly. Leaving other coworkers inside the dorm, and moving out with my seniors and some mates at the same rank, we got into two separate troop transporters and left the headquarters in New York.

"Where are we going?" asked one of my coworkers. The picket in the transporter gave a gesture of remaining silent. "We will tell you some hours later. Keep silent. Don't ask." Just one hour later, we reached the JFK Airport, which had been enlarged twice. A shuttle was in front of the troop transporters, and the picket said: "Get out and sit into the shuttle. Wish you a good journey."

After seeing Earth disappearing into the black space and Hapsaha appearing into our vision, and landing at an unknown airport, we finally realized that we had arrived at the capital of the planet Hapsaha. The driver said: "Alright, comrades, take the bus parking outside. Wish you a good morning." Outside, sunlight was shooting out of the horizon, and the black sky was stained with spreading sky blue.

As we arrived at the General Headquarters, an officer came out and ordered us to sit in Room 102. After sitting inside the room, the officer closed the door and said: "Comrades, the reason why we call you to be here is to supervise the execution, and make sure it is not leaked to outside until its completion. Enjoy the breakfast and then we will instruct you."

As the officer finished, we looked at each other in surprise and silence. "Help our forces implement the Martial Law?" One coworker whispered, "We have millions of soldiers here. They can take..." Suddenly the door opened, with the officer coming in. "Mates, your breakfast is ready."

While eating freshly baked steak with tomato sauce and black pepper sauce, the officer said after drinking a glass of milk: "You will be inspecting areas near the prison." "What prison?" An intelligencer asked. "The Central Prison in the capital. The place where we are going to execute the war criminals at midnight." Just then, everyone stopped eating. "The Central Prison?" "We must prevent a potential revolt of those capitulated alien soldiers; the GHQ just finished one two days before you arrived. Your mission is critically important. The Martial Law will be effective five minutes later. Finish the meal quickly."

"They even dare to revolt against us?" said an intelligencer in surprise. "This is not a fresh case," I replied, "There are handful of similar events when the US was not the US anymore." "Quite right," the coworker on my left whispered, "And we still have docks on Hapsaha uncontrolled." As the officer stopped in a room, he looked at the camera beside the door, which opened instantly. "Here is the monitor room that can monitor sections just outside the prison. Report us about anything suspicious on the computer to let us know. All good?" We nodded and saluted to the officer.

"Quite comfortable to sit on sofas and watch the execution." "Yeah, but we can't make any error during the period of the Martial Law," an officer who entered the room some minutes later said, "So, I won't interrupt you." "Yes, sir."

"There is nothing coming towards the wall of the prison." From the screen, a fairly rectangular white building was surrounded by a concrete wall, with barbed wires above it and guards standing alongside the road towards outside. "All clear?" "Clear." Staring at the screen was a boring and tiring job--beside drinking tea provided by the officer, there was no chance for us to switch for alternative intelligencers. Hours passed unconsciously, and suddenly, when I wanted to look away for a while for the fortieth time, the officer said: "The time has arrived!"

Displayed on the screen, a white bus just parked inside the courtyard. To our surprise, who came out of the bus were representatives of the Five Permanent States and pickets. We saw them walking into the building, and then more soldiers exiting the bus. The gallow was set up just in about five minutes by them. "It seems that the execution is about to take place. You can have a rest now."

However, no one had the intention to get off the seats, albeit their eyes were trying to force it to come true. "The war criminals are brought into the courtyard now!" I said after looking at the screen, "Looks like the soldiers are making a lottery." "What lottery?" An intelligencer looked at the screen. "Maybe deciding when to be executed." The pickets were lining beside the path to the gallow, which had thirteen steps into the noose. Those war criminals were just outside the gate.

"War Criminal 2 is going to be executed first." A voice appeared abruptly in the earphones. "What is the sound?" A coworker asked the officer. "The report from the prison. Hold on and pay attention to what may enter the courtyard." Accompanied by two pickets beside, the war criminal, with his or her hand covered in a black hood that only allowed eyes to see, slowly walked onto the path and then the steps.

"The General Headquarters," the coworker beside me answered after hearing something. "Yes, going smoothly. I see." "The supervisors inside the prison are asking about the status," he turned to the officer. "The execution is going to begin!" As I saw, the picket in front fo the noose said something to the war criminal, the latter stepped forward and turned back. The picket put another hood onto the war criminal's head, then the noose onto the neck. He gave a gesture and then, the war criminal's body sank into the gallow, with the rope shaking. Albeit bearing much joice, I still said nothing and looked at the screen. "War Criminal 2 had been executed," the sentence appeared in our ears after six minutes.

Similar pauses happened for seven times. After the voice said "All War criminals have been executed," we finally stood up and applauded, then hugging with each other. "Comrades, write a telegram to report the end of the execution." "How long?" One coworker asked. "Not long. Just a sentence--'All Eight War Criminals have been executed by hanging'. All good?" He immediately went back to the transmitter and typed the sentence.

One minute later, on my phone, which I could see after permission from the officer, a post appeared at 0:36 am--

**All Eight Clas-A War Criminals Have been Executed by Hanging**
