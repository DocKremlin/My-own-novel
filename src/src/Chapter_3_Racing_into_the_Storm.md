# Chapter 3 Racing into the Storm

*After being chasen to the beach by two last enemies, he finally could not run further. However, all three looked at something on the sea in surprise and stopped simultaneously, as if something godlike had befallen.*

*Three Galleons in line silently bobbed with the waves in a rainy storm, while several small ships carrying soldiers and priests were moving slowly towards the shore.*
