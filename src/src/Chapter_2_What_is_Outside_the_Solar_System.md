# Chapter 2 What is Outside the Solar System?

*"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water."*

From *The War of the Worlds*, by H. G. Wells, Novelist and Reporter from the UK (now Britain)
