# Wheat or Gunpowder?

Two months before the foundation of Solar Space Navy.

"The People's Alliance won the election just by 0.7% in the second round vote," an officer said to the general. "I have seen my brother announcing the results as the President pro tempore." "You don't stop him?" "I have no reason to stop him at all. If the new president Azania can bring us out of the crisis, we have no reason to start a coup. The colonizers should be the utmost enemy we should face."

"People," just then, a mid-aged alien walked onto the stage and said to thousands of others gathering in front of a building, waving various flags. "Without your support, we can't stand here. But, I still need to stress that, no matter how you are a supporter of us or an opponent to us, the government will punish any action that threatens our security. We shall eradicate the past when division hindered our development; we shall unite together to overcome the bigger mountains; we shall fulfill the promises we have made in front you..."

......

"What I have done sounded humiliating, to our people and to those colonizers. I know what I am doing is for our nation's prospect. Any trial that may bring our nation from surrounding enemies must be contested with price. Azania and our Chancellor, I sincerely wish..."

"Busy, huh," the president patted the chancellor standing in front of him, "Recently you have handled series of crises that would have led to division in our country by this moment. However, we should also rest well despite enemies' behavior of no resting to pursue their prey. The Finance Minister will give a report to the cabinet, and prepare well for it." The two figures, nearly as tall as standing honor guards beside the building gate, stood under the bath of sunset.

"Outside is Captain Sanchez of Battleship Gonzalez. The recent bombardment from the colonizers killed around sixty crews abroad. The first loss of our crews after we got the warship." "Come in." The chancellor said in a loud voice, while keeping a calm tone.

A man with fair appearance and in a military uniform entered the gate and saluted to the two figures inside the room. "President, Chancellor, I need to supplement my explanation in the report. I sent out the surrounding destroyers into outspace of the stellar system, and then those colonizers sent out more than forty bombers without any reason and bombarded us. It is my whole responsibility for the casualties, and I am willing to accept any deprivation."

"It doesn't seem to be a decision made by an experienced officer." The Chancellor said. "I thought that those colonizers would do nothing, and I tried my best to avoid their bombardment." "It is enough for you to fulfill your duty despite the losses," the Chancellor stopped for seconds and continued, "You should be praised but not be deprived off command in the Space Navy." The captain frowned and asked: "Why? I can't understand."

Just as the Chancellor wanted to continue, the captain turned to the president and asked: "How is the warship?" "It would regain combat effectiveness in a month," the man replied. The captain held his mouth tight after the president's answer, despite wanting to say something.

"You are struggling mentally, right? Tell me about your thoughts." The Chancellor continued. "I hope to relieve any possible deprivation on officers in the battleship," the captain coughed. "They were saved from the colonizers' suppression some years ago and very new on the battleship." "Continue," the president said, "We are still listening." "We struggled hard for independence from surrounding enemies, and I have no reason to blame on them."

In the others' surprise, the chancellor stood up and patted the captain's shoulder. "It is not your fault, nor any crew's fault. If any word from me embarasses you, I will apologize for it. When we need to break off from the colonizers, I wish you to fight against them as bravely as possible." "Thanks. Chancellor, president, I will return."

......

"On the other hand, we need to think about the problem of seizing the stellar systems on southeast borders. People are paying great attention on our stance on this serious matter. We must discuss it with our Defense Minister and the Interior Minister. Of course, beside it, we can discuss more."

"Why call me at this moment?" The Chancellor broke into the room and said to the Defense Minister. "Have we decided to retake those stellar systems?" The man sitting behind the desk said. "We are still discussing it, as it is one of the promises made during the election and should be done anyway. Why call me for it" The man put down the documents and continued: "We, and those generals, are concerning the serious consequences beyond." "Don't need to concern it for such an extent. If we finally decide it, we will announce it in cabinet meetings."

"Come on, chancellor, our forces and soldiers have been practicing for the action for months, even when President Azania hadn't been inaugurated," the Minister replied. "It is also our responsibility to stablize the nation and face those colonizers," the chancellor replied, "We must care about any consequence." "It is the third time you stress the word 'responsibility' in the cabinet," the Minister signed another paper on the table and replied, "You are just taking responsibility of what Azania has taken."

"Azania has been busy these weeks." The Chancellor frowned slightly and replied. "Yeah, always even in the guerilla. Always reading books, staring at maps, and broading flagships in battles. But he does not appear to be fun in front of us. In the past, we can still hear mocks and jokes from him." "Alas, personality can change with the environment," invisible sadness appeared on the Chancellor's faces. "Alright, what about the Third Fleet Expansion Plan left by our predecessors?"

"I feel that we can't build so many before the colonizers invade us"
