# Chapter 1 Phantom of Bloodshed

*What people would think of when they walk past many ancient crypts and ransacked tombs in a full moon night?*

*OF COURSE, nearly no one could conceive of a catastrophe behind the preternatural silence from this scene.*
	
From *Dawn of the Dead* by Sheley Blackburn, writer from Scotland
