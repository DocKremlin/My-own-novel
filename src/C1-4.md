# Friend or Foe?

As we continued to move on the endless express way, accompanied by burning or abandoned vehicles and corpses beside the road, there were increasing howls beside the road. Those terrible noises could only imply that we were coming near a horde of zombies, or entering the ravaged outskirts of a large city.

Suddenly, as we were only several hundreds of meters from the last interchange, a werewolf jumped out from a capsized truck and howled. It was only three hundred meters from us. It immediately stretched out its arms covered with long fur, and hands with long, sharp finger nails that seemed to smash off everything.

"Turn back!" said the Indonesian. He leant out and started shooting that monster with the rifle he had. Painful howls immediately filled the silent canopy, which made my shake. I held up the shotgun and aimed the monster with its scope. Precise as what myths had described, the monster was a true werewolf.

As we were moving back a largest speed, Jason also started shooting the monster. However, despite having its muscles penetrated by bullets, the monster even did not stop. I could see that even though we were moving back in a fast speed, the monster was still keeping charging at us. There was just no way to shake it.

I took a deep breath and immediately fired out all remaining barrels of grape-shots in the gun. The bullets hit on the head and fire started to burn its face. Despite howling even more painfully, only the running speed of the monster slowed down. It appeared as a demon running from the pandemonium, seeking humans to kill. I was desperate when the Indonesian and Jason used up all bullets.

"What can we do?" I asked Jason. "Oh, the pipe!" He took out the long pipe under the chair, and held it in the right hand. He took a deep breath and threw it out, as if he was throwing a javelin. The pipe struck into the middle of the chest, and fresh smell of blood immediately started mixing with the air. "What? That even cannot stop it!" I felt an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, and decided to throw the shotgun onto its face.

Then, a flash of light appeared from the sky without any precursor. The monster painfully covered its face, just like a vampire exposed under strong sunlight. In everyone's surprise, several laser beams penetrated its chest, and blood sprayed out. In a final howl, the monster collapsed behind.

I gasped and took a deep breath, seeing two soldiers in black combat gears with jet packs landing swiftly onto the road. One poked the dead werewolf with his assault rifle, and gave a gesture to the other. The other soldier talked back into an interphone tied near his shoulder. A third soldier also landed with a large yellow body bag in his left hand and a pistol in his right hand. He shot the dead body in its chest with the pistol several times. The other soldiers stepped onto the small pool of blood and dumped the body into the body bag. One soldier took of the blood-stained pipe and put it beside the corpse. After seeing the body bag sealed, the soldier turned to us and said: "Get down the truck for inspection immediately. For your good."

As I jumped down, I saw the sky blue badge and the white symbol in its middle, as well as the full red badge down on his arm. A Peacekeeping Force soldier from my country. Then I took a glance on one nearby. Same red badge below. A Russian one. I tried to show that I hadn't been hit by anything that sounded contagious while he was scanning my arms, legs, and my neck. The other soldiers checked my other classmates and showed two up thumbs. "Alright, you are all safe."

After a light signal given by the Chinese soldier, the thing like a helicopter landed with little noise. The newest armed helicopter for Peacekeeping Forces. "Take them with us! That is the mission!" a soldier on the helicopter said in a very low voice. We stepped into the helicpoter and sat in seats appointed by those soldiers. A man with a fine figure, wearing similar standard combat gears was sitting beside the door to the driving cabin.

The plane started to take off after we gave all those weapons to the soldiers. Shadowed hills and roads on the horizon began to fade away, replaced by black canopy decorated by stars and clouds under the light of the moon. "Honestly tell me, who are you?" The man said. "We are from the Peacekeeping Force."

Jason gave me a look with hesitation. The other classmates looked at me. I took a breath and said: "We are students who are staying in Tompkins for MSc research project. Then when we heard about the war, we ran all the way to D.C. for finding our embassy to get back." "Alright, I see." The man replied. "Take us to the headquarters," the soldier said to the intercom. "Copy that."
