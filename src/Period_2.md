# Period 2

**Preface**

Those who colonize civilizations are conciliatory and eclectic: if people simply wanted to demand a change, they would definitely oppose them by force and terror; if people resisted hard by protests of millions and armed revolt at great expense of themselves, they would finally agree to achieve the change. Throughout history, those ancient struggles such as the Indian Uprising, Anpo Protests, had proved the point. Still, as colonizers, no matter how they cost in conquering civilizations, while facing tremendous profits aftermath, they would still rush there to get profits for themselves.

As the great fear of another civil war inside the Solar System was relieved after the arrival of surrendered Hapsaha, it was a precious time to reconcile, reconstruct, and reform. Our lives had to move forward; only by reconstructing our homeland, building up a stronger Space Navy, and prospering our cities and settlements in Mars and on the Moon could repay sacrifices of our people and those aliens who struggled for reconciliation. Gaining a brand-new Space Navy that was much more powerful than our dozens of spatial fighters gave us a solid shield to ensure our post-war peace. As those aliens described, those massive ships they called as "light cruisers" and "destroyers" were much smaller than warships that those "aliens" they had encountered owned. One way, our Space Navy was sufficient in defending the Solar System; on the contrary, we were fragile to even stronger enemies.

Enemies, those that the generals in the Joint Defense Committee considered, were referring to those aliens that manipulated the whole chaos in Hapsaha and in Earth, which would be much more powerful than any of us. Now, the Solar system was like an innocent human that just walked into "the pandemonium of universe", as some people on Earth boasted. There were demons hiding behind the glorious pandemonium, stretching their arms out and raising tridents to get ready for hunting any human that dared to wander inside. Even without revealing our universal coordinates to those demons, we just walked into the pandemonium without noticing it. For hunters, a prey that had walked into a road to their traps without notice was precious; it was not an easily encountered situation during hunting experiences. Nevertheless, once the prey figures out the trap, it will try every way it can do to evade the imminent danger, regardless how many bullets it will be shot.

Those aliens noted the existence of countries over stellar systems in the Galaxy--which was an astonishing fact--no humans, including top generals in the Security Council, were aware of it. Finding a previously undiscovered stellar system rich in planets and resources was like discovering a freshly baked pizza of 18 inch left in a box in the middle of the road that everyone walking past want to scrap a piece from it. It took centuries for "modern countries" (which i mean all Member States in the UN) on Earth to fully unite together to reconcile with past internal conflicts and walk to space; for interstellar countries in hypothesis, much bigger conflicts would be present, especially when carving up unknown stellar systems with others or gaining support from unknown stellar system upon a crisis of war. In previous world wars, neutral countries had been a target for belligerents to attract to assist their war effort; the same applied to warfare in the Galaxy, which, unfortunately for us, would arrive soon, and inevitably change our homeland.
