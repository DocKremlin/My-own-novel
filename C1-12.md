# Operation Injection (3)

Helicpoters roared into the sky, from carriers, cruisers that were shooting the gigantic warship from the sea, and land bases. Each carrying a squadron of twelve, they would charge through dangerous flak firepower that could easily smash them into pieces.

"There are even more hostile targets!" An officer said in panic. "If we hadn't cancelled hacking over their ships..." The alien said in regret, "Now all of our shields are defending missiles shooting our bottom." "Helicpoters?" An officer looked at the screen in surprise, "that's basically our first-generation carrier spacecrafts!" "What helicpoters? We haven't used the term for...wait a minute..." He stared at the screen.

The lady ran downstairs, running through the corridor and turned right. She could saw explosions among the clouds and planes falling down in flames, as well as missiles flying from below and above. "Hey, what are you doing?" A crew shouted from tens of meters ahead of her. She said nothing and continued to run forward. "Stop! I need to check you!" As he started to pull the pistol out, she immediately took the hand and hit his head by her left hand. Within a moment, she hit the crew's arm again and got the pistol. With no hesitation, she kicked the crew onto the wall. The crew fell onto the ground just like a sponge.

"We are taking off!" said Jason as he looked at the sky and diminishing ships. "Yes," replied Danny, "That is our task." "Comrades! Check your equipments last time! This is not a drill!" "Where are we going to breach?" a soldier asked. "See where we can go!" The pilot replied, "I will make you safe!"

The helicopter immediately got aimed by anti-aircraft turrets as it reached the same height, four thousand meters from the large ship. "The ship is very large!" Another soldier said in great surprise. "Keep your breath steady and do not feel ill!" The pilot said. Just then, he made a sharp turn towards the left, and then resumed the original flying direction. Two missiles flew straight from the left side of the helicopter, and there were lasers shot from turrets flying past other helicpoters.

What happened above the sky was like ancient humans hunting down a mammoth. A helicopter was shot by two missiles, and it exploded with only ashes left. Another one that was very close to an open vault was taken down by a laser that detonated its engines. The helicpoters were flying like ships in storms, trying to reach the formidable and invincible warship.

"Two thousand meters!" The pilot said after dogding some laser beams, "Prepare to jump!"

They checked their gears one last time and looked at the warship from the windows. An open hangar was just some distance away, with its planes randomly parked. "Alright guys, this is not a drill!" Danny said after stepping onto the hatch door, "Prepare well! Make sure this is a sure success!"

"Jump!" The pilot said. As the hatch door opened, large volume of air rushed into the cabin. Below was Egypt-Sudan lands depicted by deserts, oases, cities, lakes, and the Red Sea. Without looking down even for a glance, Danny immediately clicked the button connected to the jetpack beside his right arm, and he roared into the sky, straight to the open door. Jason waved his hand at others, giving a gesture of "follow up!" to the other soldiers inside. He pressed the same button and roared into the sky.

Within twenty seconds, Danny setup a defense wall in front of dozen enemies that dared to defend the open hangar that could draw them out of the ship. Jason landed beside him and took out a rocket launcher. "Take it, launch a smoke bomb!" He put his rifle at the back and took the rocket launcher. As the smoke filled the hangar, following soldiers threw grenades onto the solid gate. Just after a minute, beside planes that were left, several corpses lay beside the entrance.

"Invaders are breaching outer structures and infiltrating the whole ship!" an alien said in great panic. "Should we just abandon the ship and escape?" The man turned to the captain. "They are breaking our hangars, where can we go beside landing the planet?" "What about the recon planes that are able to bring us to the original planet?" An officer said. "Are you mad?" The captain said in fury, "Our planet is just heading here and suffering from riots, and our return there will be a death sentence for those revolutionaries!"

"Corridor clear!" said Danny after shooting down two enemies. "Where is our agent here?" "She should be close, shouldn't she?" Jason said after scanning a nearby room. "Hands up!" a soldier shouted after breaking into a nearby cabin. Danny followed him and saw a lady wearing a very different military uniform standing with her hands up. "Fireteams 2 and 3, stay alert!"

He walked in the room and turned to the soldier. "Good, now we find the agent." "Great to see you again," the lady replied after giving a salute. "Wear some proper equipment," said Danny after getting a bullet proof and a set of exoskeleton from a nearby soldier searching the room.

As she finished wearing, a soldier gave her a rifle. "Come if you want not die," said Danny, "We will finish up those bastards."

......

"Abandon the ship?" The officer's jaw nearly dropped out of his face. "Yes. Abandon the ship! We can escape and hide, just let those humans sink with this already dead ship!" The captain threw his cap onto the ground. "All officers, retreat the ship! Repeat!" "What the heck? Are you insane?!" The "leader" shouted angrily. However, the ship suddenly shook everyone down inside its bridge.

"We can reach the bridge just by the stairs!" said the agent. "Are you sure? To go to its highest part when the ship is about to capsize above the sky?" said Jason after adjusting his helmet and the rifle. "It must be where those conspirators stay," replied Danny, "And below are thousands of people inside cities in Ethiopia! We can't lose even more people!"

"Run away now!" The captain shouted, "Just use me to compensate all the losses!" Other officers and humans inside the captain began to flee out of the bridge, leaving dead facilities and the captain, as well as the "leader".

"It turns out that you want to go down with the ship?" The man took out a rifle after taking off his suit jacket, "It seems that you do not want to help us to destroy those low-life scums, don't you?" "Why are you pointing the gun at me! Many people are like..." "How dare you!" He pulled the bolt on the gun. "I remember that twenty years ago, you failed to kill the head of the Earth government in an operation; you now even fail to kill off those humans with us."

The ship shook again. "Say no more! You are not qualified to comment on us!" The captain said in light fear and great anger.

"One last floor!" said Jason after looking at the sign. "Let me go first!" Danny put a grenade on his left shoulder and checked it, "You can prepare to call surface forces or the Space Force to pick us up." "Pick us from thousands of meters above?" Jason was in surprise. "Don't you remember the practice?"

"Just let me do it," the agent said. "You evacuate the ship."
